# Hi 9Spokes team and other applicants who are having a geez at my solution,.
My solution uses ReactJS and Jest for testing.

It uses axios to fetch the data from your repo on GitHub.

It uses antd for styling and formatting in the front end.

To run this, use yarn start.
To view the test suite use yarn test.
